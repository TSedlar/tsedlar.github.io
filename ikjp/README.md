# ikjp
A japanese typing practice quiz located [here](https://sedlar.me/ikjp)

Makes use of my microframework [eltag](https://github.com/TSedlar/eltag)

The main use of this is to type the result into the input bar using an IME, so that it tests your knowledge of hiragana/katakana/kanji (if you toggle off furigana)

You can otherwise use it as a tool to learn vocabulary.
